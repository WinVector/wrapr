Description: Provides 'DebugFnW()' to capture function context on error for
    debugging, and 'let()' which converts non-standard evaluation interfaces to
    standard evaluation interfaces.
    'DebugFnW()' captures the calling function and arguments prior to the 
    call causing the exception, while 
    the classic 'options(error=dump.frames)' form captures at the
    moment of the exception
    itself (thus function arguments may not be at their starting values).
    'let()' rebinds (possibly unbound) names to names, which is different than
    'with()' rebinds names to values.

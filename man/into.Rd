\examples{

# name capture version
into[a, b] <- list(5, 10)
print(a)  # now 5
print(b)  # now 10

# bquote re-direct to value in variable using .()
# Note: the bquote .() step is potentially confusing, as the user
# can't immediately see where the value is being assigned to.
# Also, quotes are allowed.
a <- 'x'
into[.(a), 'b'] <- list(20, 40)
print(x)  # now 20
print(b)  # now 40
print(a)  # still 'x'
